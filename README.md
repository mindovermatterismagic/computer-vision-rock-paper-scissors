# Computer Vision RPS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera. 

## Milestone 1 

- Creates a remote github repository for this project to version control the software.

- Connects the remote repository to a local clone using the command line.

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/d4min/computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors.git
```

## Milestone 2

Created and trained a deep learning model using Teachable Machine to recognise images of users gesturing rock, paper, scissors or nothing through the webcam.
